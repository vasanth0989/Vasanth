This app will make use of the log files generated by the CA application, It will generate an output file where we can able to see the list of flow and state details it navigated. 
The output file contains flow name,state name,executed class and method names, view definition, sub flow details...etc. 
Moreover the output generated from flow logger application are Java objects and we can utilize those objects for multiple purpose. 
Flow logger is a tool which helps you to generate flow diagrams from your log files which gives good idea to the developer how the application works internally.
 
Advantages:
 
 As of now for CA production defects, we spend 80% of our time in analysis on fixing the defect because our application has n number of files. 
This tool will really help to reduce the time spend in analyzing the code, since the output file generated from the tool will give the clear picture to the developers on and what methods and flows are all got executed. 
This tool even help the new joiners as they will have good understanding on reading the output file or looking at the flow diagrams.
 
Time/Effort Saved: 
 
​This tool helps to reduce more than 60% of the time spend in analyzing the defect or code.
