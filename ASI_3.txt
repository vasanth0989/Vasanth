Driven by an Architecture to promote modularity in Customer Assist - reference implementation to be built in house.
Initial implementation was to be a platform built on Spring Web Flow to reuse “Modules”.
Regulatory demand drove reusability X-LOB – TCPA, KYC, SCRA, etc.
Decisions made ASI a development stack to quickly build Applications & Modules not only in the DSST space, but for the whole of CCB.

UI Framework
Support client side only development to build stateless web applications and modules.  Parallel to Chase 3.0 and work toward a “Core Framework” convergence in the future.
Support Spring HATEAOS Restful Webservices to drive Presentation.
Continue to support tagging strategy for JSPs and Stateful development (Spring Web Flow) for backward compatibility and potential application needs.

Testing
Unit Testing strategies for JavaScript and Java code.
Automated Testing strategies (used on reference application in ASI as well as built Apps and Modules)

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that uses only one HTML web page as a shell for all the application's web pages and whose end-user interactions are implemented by using HTML, JS, and CSS.
SPA’s react appropriately to changes in data.

AMD
Asynchronous Module Definition
JavaScript specification that defines an API for defining code modules and their dependencies, and loading them asynchronously
Provides encapsulation of modules
AMDs obviate the need for name spacing through global variables.

Client Side
Module System (AMD): RequireJS (www.requirejs.org)
Core MVC: CanJS (canjs.com)
Routing: PageJS (visionmedia.github.io/page.js)
Util (Ajax, Promise, DOM, etc.): JQuery (jquery.com)
View: Ractive.js (www.ractivejs.org) (and potentially other mustache compatible templates)
Unit Testing: Jasmine (jasmine.github.io)
Packaging: NPM (www.npmjs.com) & Bower (bower.io)
Build System: Gulp (gulpjs.com)
Server Side
Java: 
JavaSE 6+
JavaEE 6+ compatible Web Server (currently Websphere AS)
Spring MVC
Leverage Spring HATEAOS for Hypermedia driven servicing – true REST.
Spring Webflow for stateful applications.
Java Standard Tag Library
Custom tags to leverage client side technology in JSPs for backward compatibility with ASI 2.x-.
